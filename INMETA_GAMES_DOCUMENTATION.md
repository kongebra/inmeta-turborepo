## Overview

### What is Inmeta Games?

Inmeta Games is a tournament management and scoring system designed to track gaming competitions within an organization. The system allows administrators to:
- Create and manage tournaments
- Organize multiple games within each tournament
- Track participant performance and rankings
- Award points based on a configurable scoring system
- Display real-time scoreboards
- Maintain player profiles and participation history

The platform serves both administrative users (who input data via a CMS) and public users (who view tournament results and player statistics).

## Core Concepts

### Tournament
A tournament is a collection of games played over a period. Each tournament:
- Has a unique name and identifier
- Contains multiple games
- Defines its own point scoring rules
- Maintains a scoreboard ranking all participants

### Game
A game is a single competitive event within a tournament where:
- Participants compete for placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)
- Organizers coordinate the event
- Spectators can watch without competing
- Results determine point allocations

### Person
A person represents any individual who can:
- Participate in games
- Organize games
- Spectate games
- Accumulate points across multiple tournaments

### Point System
Points are awarded based on various actions:
- Participating in a game
- Placing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
- Organizing a game (with or without participation)
- Spectating a game

---

## Data Models

### 1. Person (Document)

**Purpose**: Represents an individual who can participate in, organize, or spectate games.

**Fields**:
- `firstName` (String, Required): Person's first name
- `lastName` (String, Required): Person's last name
- `image` (Image, Optional): Profile picture with hotspot capability for cropping

**Relationships**:
- Referenced by Game entities as participants, organizers, spectators, or placement winners

**Display**:
- Preview shows full name (firstName + lastName) and profile image

---

### 2. Tournament (Document)

**Purpose**: Container for a series of games with unified scoring rules.

**Fields**:
- `name` (String, Required): Tournament name
- `slug` (Slug, Required): URL-friendly identifier, auto-generated from name (max 96 characters)
- `games` (Array of Game Objects): Collection of games in this tournament
- `pointRules` (TournamentPointRules Object): Scoring configuration for this tournament

**Organizational Groups**:
The data is organized into three logical sections:
1. **Info**: Basic tournament information (name, slug)
2. **Games**: List of games in the tournament
3. **Point Rules**: Scoring configuration

---

### 3. Game (Object, not Document)

**Purpose**: Represents a single competitive event within a tournament.

**Fields**:

*Basic Information:*
- `name` (String, Required): Game name
- `description` (Text, Optional): Detailed description of the game
- `image` (Image, Optional): Game image with hotspot capability

*Organization:*
- `organiziers` (Array of Person References): People who organized this game
- `isOrganizersParticipating` (Boolean, Default: false): Whether organizers also participated as players

*Participation:*
- `participants` (Array of Person References): All people who played this game

*Results:*
- `isDone` (Boolean, Default: false): Whether results are finalized and ready for display
- `firstPlace` (Array of Person References): Winner(s) - supports ties
- `secondPlace` (Array of Person References): Second place finisher(s) - supports ties
- `thirdPlace` (Array of Person References): Third place finisher(s) - supports ties

*Spectators:*
- `spectators` (Array of Person References): People who watched but didn't participate

**Organizational Groups**:
1. **Info**: Basic game details
2. **Participants**: Player list
3. **Results**: Placement results
4. **Spectators**: Observer list

**Key Business Rules**:
- A game can have multiple people in any placement (supporting ties)
- Organizers may or may not participate as players
- Only games marked as `isDone` are included in scoreboard calculations

---

### 4. TournamentPointRules (Object, not Document)

**Purpose**: Defines the point allocation system for a tournament.

**Fields** (all Number, Required, with default values):
- `participation` (Default: 3): Points awarded just for participating in a game
- `firstPlace` (Default: 3): Additional points for winning (1st place)
- `secondPlace` (Default: 2): Additional points for 2nd place
- `thirdPlace` (Default: 1): Additional points for 3rd place
- `organizedWithParticipation` (Default: 1): Points for organizing a game while also playing
- `organizedWithoutParticipation` (Default: 3): Points for organizing a game without playing
- `spectator` (Default: 1): Points awarded for spectating

**Important Notes**:
- Placement points (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are **in addition to** participation points
- Example: A first-place winner with default rules gets participation (3) + firstPlace (3) = 6 total points
- Organizing points are mutually exclusive based on the `isOrganizersParticipating` flag

---

## Business Logic

### 1. Scoreboard Calculation

The scoreboard aggregates all completed games in a tournament and calculates each person's total score.

**Algorithm**:

For each completed game (where `isDone` is true):

1. **Participation Points**:
   - Award `participation` points to everyone in `participants` array
   
2. **Placement Points**:
   - Award `firstPlace` points to everyone in `firstPlace` array
   - Award `secondPlace` points to everyone in `secondPlace` array
   - Award `thirdPlace` points to everyone in `thirdPlace` array
   
3. **Organizer Points**:
   - If `isOrganizersParticipating` is true:
     - Award `organizedWithParticipation` points to each organizer
     - Also award `participation` points (they are counted as participants)
   - If `isOrganizersParticipating` is false:
     - Award `organizedWithoutParticipation` points to each organizer
     - Do NOT award participation points

4. **Spectator Points**:
   - Award `spectator` points to everyone in `spectators` array

**Scoring Formula for a Person**:
```
Total Score = 
  (participations × participation) +
  (firstPlaces × firstPlace) +
  (secondPlaces × secondPlace) +
  (thirdPlaces × thirdPlace) +
  (organizedWithParticipations × organizedWithParticipation) +
  (organizedWithoutParticipations × organizedWithoutParticipation) +
  (spectatorCount × spectator)
```

**Ranking**:
- Players are sorted by total score (descending)
- Ties are handled: multiple players with the same score share the same rank
- Example: If two players tie for 2nd place with equal scores, both get rank 2, and the next player gets rank 4

---

### 2. Point System Rationale

The default point values reflect these principles:

- **Participation is valued**: Base 3 points encourages involvement
- **Winning matters**: Additional 3 points doubles your reward
- **Organization without playing is valuable**: 3 points recognizes pure organizing effort
- **Multiple roles stack**: An organizer who also plays and wins can accumulate multiple point categories
- **Spectating is acknowledged**: 1 point provides minor recognition for engagement

---

### 3. Player Statistics Tracking

For each player across all games in a tournament, the system tracks:

**Participation Metrics**:
- Total number of games participated in
- Total number of games spectated

**Performance Metrics**:
- Count of 1st place finishes
- Count of 2nd place finishes
- Count of 3rd place finishes

**Organization Metrics**:
- Count of games organized with participation
- Count of games organized without participation

**Aggregated Score**:
- Total points earned (calculated using the formula above)
- Rank position on the scoreboard

---

### 4. Player Profile History

When viewing a player's profile, the system shows:

**For Each Tournament**:
- Tournament name
- List of games the player participated in

**For Each Game Participation**:
- Game name
- Placement achieved (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or "Participated")
- Whether the player was an organizer

**Implementation Note**:
- Only games marked as `isDone` are included in player history
- Uses a database query that finds all tournaments referencing the player and filters to completed games

- Images use grayscale with hover effects
- Loading states with skeleton components

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology-Agnostic Requirements

Any implementation of this system should provide:

#### 1. Data Storage
- **Document/Entity Storage**: 
  - Person entities with profile information
  - Tournament entities with metadata
  
- **Relational Capabilities**:
  - Games linked to tournaments (one-to-many)
  - Games referencing persons (many-to-many)
  - Support for multiple references per role (participants, organizers, placements, spectators)

- **Image Handling**:
  - Store images with support for transforms/cropping (hotspot)
  - Generate URLs for web display

#### 2. Content Management
Provide an administrative interface to:
- Create/edit/delete persons
- Create/edit/delete tournaments
- Add games to tournaments
- Assign people to various game roles
- Mark games as complete
- Configure point rules per tournament

#### 3. Public API/Query Interface
Support queries for:
- List all tournaments
- Get tournament details with all games and populated person references
- List all persons
- Get person details with participation history across tournaments
- Filter games by completion status

#### 4. Business Logic Implementation
Implement the scoreboard calculation algorithm:
- Iterate through completed games
- Accumulate statistics per person
- Calculate total points using the formula
- Sort and rank players

#### 5. Frontend Display
Create views for:
- Tournament listing
- Tournament detail with scoreboard
- Game detail with results
- Player listing
- Player profile with history

### Data Validation Rules

**Person**:
- First name and last name required
- Image optional but recommended

**Tournament**:
- Name required
- Slug must be unique
- Point rules required with numeric values

**Game**:
- Name required
- Can have zero or more people in any role
- Placement arrays can have multiple people (supporting ties)
- `isDone` flag determines scoreboard inclusion
- If organizers participate, they must also be in participants array

**Point Rules**:
- All values must be numbers
- Negative values should be prevented (or allowed if subtracting points is desired)
- Default values provided for all fields

### Performance Considerations

**Caching Strategy**:
- Tournament lists: Low-frequency updates (can cache 1-5 minutes)
- Tournament details: Medium-frequency updates (cache 1 minute)
- Player lists: Low-frequency updates (can cache 1-5 minutes)
- Player details: Medium-frequency updates (cache 1 minute)

**Query Optimization**:
- Use reference expansion/joins to minimize database roundtrips
- Pre-calculate scoreboards if tournaments are large
- Index on common query fields (tournament ID, person ID, isDone flag)

### Localization Notes

The current implementation uses Norwegian language labels:
- "Turnering" = Tournament
- "Spill" = Game
- "Deltakere" = Participants
- "Tilskuere" = Spectators
- "Arrangører" = Organizers
- "Poengregler" = Point Rules

Any reimplementation should support internationalization.
